# *Steps to run the code to achieve the desired results* :

The whole code is written in **MaxTemp.java file** For code please follow that file.


Create a Schema named **"Phase3"** in the mysql server and use this **Phase3** for further steps.

1. Copy the eclipse project into Vagrant_getting_started.
2. By using Power shell, Start the vagrant by giving a command: **vagrant up**
3. Start the Vagrant machine by using the command: **vagrant ssh** 
4. Now navigate to the home directory by using the command: **cd/**
5. Change the directory to see the project name **"max_temp"**
6. Copy all the .gz files in the src folder of the project, to get the dataset.
7. Compile the project by navigating to the directory src by using the command **javac max_temp/MaxTemp.java**
8. Run the project by using the command **java max_temp/MaxTemp**.

After running the program, we will have a choice to execute different datasets i.e **Dataset 1** or **Dataset 2**
